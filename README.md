# Engineering-Projects
These are source codes, primarily written in python, for projects I've made.

* Energy Efficient Stove (Food Energy Calculator.py)

In Engineering 120 Introduction to Engineering, I was tasked with a group to design a stove to minimize energy usage and emission output intended for those living in developing nations. I wrote a program in Python to calculate the energy required to cook a meal with inputs from the ingredients' specific heat capacities and densities.

* Autonomous Collision Avoidance Car (Car_Test.ino)

In Engineering 115 Engineering Graphics, I was tasked to build an autonomous car that would drive through a course of a combination of four straights and four turns. I increased the efficiency of this task by adding a method that would allow the car to reverse if it detected a range of zero to ten inches, which allowed it to have higher collision avoidance. This code was written in C/C++ and uploaded to an Arduino unit.

* Project N-Molar (N-Molar.py)

Over break, I wanted to practice more Python related skills and brush up on basic chemistry skills. The premise of it is to take inputs of the element symbol OR name and then print out its molar mass. In addition, another option for the user is to enter the mass, and the program will give the corresponding element. Updates that I wish to contribute to this project is a molar mass calculator option of compounds. Also, I could possible print out error messages to users if compound could not physically exist based on existing laws/guidlines.
