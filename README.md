# Engineering-Projects
These are source codes, primarily written in python, for projects I've made.

* Stove for Developing Nations (Food Energy Calculator.py)

In Engineering 120 Introduction to Engineering, I was tasked with a group to design a stove to minimize energy usage and emission output. I wrote a program in Python to calculate the energy required to cook a meal with inputs from the ingredients' specific heat capacities and densities.

* Autonomous Collision Avoidance Car (Car_Test.ino)

In Engineering 115 Engineering Graphics, I was tasked to build an autonomous car that would drive through a course of a combination of four straights and four turns. I increased the efficiency of this task by adding a method that would allow the car to reverse if it detected a range of zero to ten inches, which allowed it to have higher collision avoidance. This code was written in C/C++ and uploaded to an Arduino unit.
