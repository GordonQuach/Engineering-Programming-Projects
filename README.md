# Engineering/Programming Projects
These are source codes, primarily written in python, for projects I've made. NOTE: I have more projects/assignments that I completed by myself for CS 1064: Introduction to Programming in Python. However, to prevent Honor Code Violations, I have made the repository secret. Please request if you are interested in seeing them.

* Energy Efficient Stove (Food Energy Calculator.py)

In Engineering 120 Introduction to Engineering, I was tasked with a group to design a stove to minimize energy usage and emission output intended for those living in developing nations. I wrote a program in Python to calculate the energy required to cook a meal with inputs from the ingredients' specific heat capacities and densities.

* Autonomous Collision Avoidance Car (Car_Test.ino)

In Engineering 115 Engineering Graphics, I was tasked to build an autonomous car that would drive through a course of a combination of four straights and four turns. I increased the efficiency of this task by adding a method that would allow the car to reverse if it detected a range of zero to ten inches, which allowed it to have higher collision avoidance. This code was written in Arduino language and uploaded to an Arduino unit.

* Project N-Molar (N-Molar.py)

Over break, I wanted to practice more Python related skills and brush up on basic chemistry skills. The premise of it is to take inputs of the element symbol OR name and then print out its molar mass. In addition, another option for the user is to enter the mass, and the program will give the corresponding element. Updates that I wish to contribute to this project is a molar mass calculator option of compounds. Also, I could possible print out error messages to users if compound could not physically exist based on existing laws/guidlines. 

* Battleship (Battleship.py)

Another project I tried to tackle during my break was to try out a popular coding project: Battleship! This was done with help of Codeacademy's Python course since I was also practicing other minor python/programming skills. Though the game is finished, I see it at it's premature stage. Updates that I would like to contribute to this project are user inputs of the dimensions of the board and/or amount of ships. Also, I wish to use this project to learn and implement machine learning/AI.

* Bioinformatics Practice (Bio.py)

As the title suggests, I have written a program in Python to analyze the count of genetic material in a DNA strand. The user would enter a text file into the program containing such data and my program should do the rest. This simple project has helped me practice basic data analysis as well a fun way to learn how to use the terminal on my Macbook. It also helped introduce me into the field of bioinformatics. An update I would like to see in this program is a way for it to output the count of genetic material into a word/text file for the user to use in a presentation and/or report. 

* Permutations (Permutations Print.py)

Wanted to play around with finding out permutations for a range of numbers. User would be able to attain output in a text file. Future updates may be to allow user to enter the values they want to run a permutation of.
